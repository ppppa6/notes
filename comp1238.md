## Week 1 - History

- Evolution of Writing
    - Sumerian Language: Used syllabic writing.
    - Epic of Gilgamesh: Early literature (~4,000 years ago).
    - Multilingual Inscriptions: Example of trilingual inscriptions (Old Persian, Elamite, Babylonian)

- Number Systems

    - Babylonian Numerals:
        - System using two types of wedges, one means 10 the other means 1.
        - Numbers up to 59 are jsut sum of the two types wedges.
        - Then positional base-60 system similar to modern base-10.

    - Other Systems:
        - Egyptian: Symbols for powers of 10.
        - Roman: Subtractive notation (e.g., MCM = 1900).

 
- Key Terminology

    - Typeface: Design of letters.
    - Font: Collection of typefaces.
    - Serif/Sans Serif: Fonts with/without decorative strokes.
    - Uppercase/Lowercase: Originated from physical storage cases.


## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes

### Key Concepts

- Binary System

    - Bit: Short for binary digit, represents one of two states (0 or 1).
    - Byte: Group of 8 bits.
    - Binary Numbers: Numbers represented using base 2.

- Memory Types

    - Volatile Memory: Loses data when power is off (e.g., RAM).
    - Non-Volatile Memory: Retains data without power (e.g., SSD, HDD).

- Number Representation

    - Unsigned Numbers: Range from 0 to 255 for 8 bits.
    - Signed Numbers: Range from -128 to 127 for 8 bits.
    - Fractional Numbers: Represented using scientific notation with two integers.

- Text Representation

    - ASCII Table: Maps numbers to characters (e.g., 65 for 'A').
    - Control Codes: Non-printable characters for control functions (e.g., newline).

- File Types

    - Text Files: Interpreted as characters using ASCII.
    - Binary Files: Not intended to be read as text.


## Week 3 - Text Structure

- Markup Languages

    - Markdown:
        - Simple syntax for formatting.
        - Titles: # Title, ## Subtitle
        - Italic: _italic\_
        - Bold: **bold\*\*
        - Lists: * item or - item
        - Rendering: Conversion from raw text to formatted view.

    - HTML:
        - More verbose than Markdown.
        - Tags: <ul\>, <li\>, <p\>, <strong\>, <h1\>, <h2\>, <h3\>

- Unicode

    - Similar to ASCII - assigns numbers to characters, but allows for much larger numbers and therefore more characters.
    - While in ASCII the numbers are called "ASCII codes", in unicode the name used is "Unicode codepoints"
    - In contrast to ASCII there are multiple different ways of converting the codepoints into a binary representation:
        - UTF-32 simply uses 4 bytes to store the codepoint number of in binary, but this wastes a lot of space because most bytes end up being filled with zeroes.
        - UTF-8 is identical to ASCII for all the basic characters but uses multiple bytes for codepoints above 127. UTF-8 is by far the most popular encoding on the internet.
    - Unicode codepoints are usually written as hex number with prefix U+ for example U+21AA is the codepoint for this character: â†ª
    - Note that the binary representation for this codepoint will be different depending on which encoding is used, but in most cases we use UTF-8.


## Week 4 - Keyboards and Editors

- Keyboard Mastery

    - Importance: Efficient typing reduces cognitive load.
    - Types:
        - Standard 104-key layout.
        - Variants like split, vertical, and ortholinear keyboards.
    - Layouts:
        - QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak.
    - Modifier Keys: modify the behavior of other keys - Control, Shift, Alt etc.
    - Touch Typing: Encouraged for efficiency and reduced fatigue.

- Text Editors

    - Types:
        - Word Processors (e.g., Microsoft Word) vs. Text Editors (e.g., Notepad).
    - Popular Editors:
        - Vim: Command-line based, requires learning commands.
            - Exit command: :q!
        - Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Widely used, feature-rich.
            - Extensions and themes available.
    - IDEs: Integrated Development Environments like WebStorm, Pycharm.

## Week 5 - CLI

- Modern CLI Usage  
  - **Advantages**:  
    - Some functionalities are only available via CLI.  
    - Faster for certain tasks compared to graphical interfaces.  
    - Easier automation through scripting.  
    - Efficient for remote work with low bandwidth requirements.  
    - Minimal resource usage on computers.  

- Basic CLI Commands  
  - **Navigation and File Management**:  
    - `ls`: List files in a directory.  
    - `cd`: Change directory.  
    - `pwd`: Print working directory.  
    - `cat`: Display file contents.  
    - `less`: View file contents interactively.  
    - `cp`: Copy files.  
    - `mv`: Move files.  
    - `mkdir`: Create a directory.  
    - `ping`: Test network connectivity.
   
- Advanced Commands:  
  - `grep`: Search text using patterns.  
  - Redirection and piping: Direct output to files or other commands.
